# Testing Infrastructure Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the comprehensive testing infrastructure issues discovered in the Kin Workspace CMS. The current testing implementation has multiple critical failures including database connection issues, missing components, incomplete mocks, and configuration problems. This spec addresses the systematic resolution of all testing issues to achieve a fully functional, reliable test suite with proper coverage and CI/CD integration.

3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL mock JWT token generation and validation
4. WHEN NextAuth is imported THEN the system SHALL not encounter ES module compatibility issues
5. WHEN testing auth utilities THEN the system SHALL properly mock password hashing and validation

### Requirement 4: Missing API Routes Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all referenced API routes to exist so that integration tests can properly test the complete application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/me` endpoints
2. WHEN testing public APIs THEN the system SHALL provide `/api/public/products` and `/api/public/categories` endpoints
3. WHEN testing workflow features THEN the system SHALL provide `/api/workflow` and `/api/workflow/revisions` endpoints
4. WHEN testing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide `/api/analytics` and `/api/analytics/export` endpoints
5. WHEN API routes are called THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP responses with expected data structures

### Requirement 5: Missing Component Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all referenced components to exist so that component tests can properly validate UI functionality and user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing product features THEN the system SHALL provide `ProductImageGallery` and `MediaPicker` components
2. WHEN testing page management THEN the system SHALL provide `PageList`, `PageForm`, and `TemplateSelector` components
3. WHEN testing media management THEN the system SHALL provide `MediaFolderTree`, `MediaBulkActions`, and `MediaMetadataEditor` components
4. WHEN testing shared functionality THEN the system SHALL provide `CategorySelector` and `RichTextEditorWithMedia` components
5. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL provide proper props interfaces and event handling

### Requirement 6: Service Layer Completion

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete service implementations so that service tests can validate business logic and data operations properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing caching THEN the system SHALL provide complete `CacheService`, `ImageCache`, and `DatabaseCache` implementations
2. WHEN testing search functionality THEN the system SHALL provide complete search service with all referenced methods
3. WHEN services are instantiated THEN the system SHALL provide proper singleton patterns and configuration options
4. WHEN service methods are called THEN the system SHALL return expected data types and handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN services interact with external dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide proper mocking and isolation

### Requirement 7: Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can be confident in code quality and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring test coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute all 427+ tests successfully without failures
3. WHEN tests validate functionality THEN the system SHALL use proper assertions and meaningful test descriptions
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL cover error conditions, boundary values, and invalid inputs
5. WHEN tests are maintained THEN the system SHALL provide clear test organization and documentation

### Requirement 8: Mock Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive mocking strategy so that tests are isolated, fast, and reliable without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mocking Prisma THEN the system SHALL provide deep mocks with proper method implementations
2. WHEN mocking NextAuth THEN the system SHALL simulate authentication states and session management
3. WHEN mocking external services THEN the system SHALL provide consistent mock responses and error scenarios
4. WHEN mocks are reset THEN the system SHALL properly clean up mock state between tests
5. WHEN mock expectations are set THEN the system SHALL validate mock calls and parameters correctly

### Requirement 9: Integration Test Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable integration tests so that I can validate complete workflows and API interactions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL use real database connections with proper test isolation
2. WHEN testing API workflows THEN the system SHALL validate complete request/response cycles
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL validate login, registration, and profile access workflows
4. WHEN testing data operations THEN the system SHALL validate CRUD operations with proper data persistence
