# Task 7: Security Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements for the CMS Admin system, addressing critical security vulnerabilities and implementing enterprise-grade security measures.

## Current Security Assessment

### Issues Identified
1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Found in test files and scripts
2. **Missing CSRF Protection**: Limited implementation
3. **Insufficient Input Validation**: Some API endpoints lack proper validation
4. **Security Monitoring**: Basic implementation needs enhancement
5. **Test Security**: Hardcoded passwords and secrets in test files

### Security Strengths
- Comprehensive security alerting system already implemented
- Zod validation in many API endpoints
- JWT-based authentication
- Audit logging system in place

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Fix Security Issues in Test Code âœ…
- Remove hardcoded credentials from test files
- Implement proper test data masking
- Add security scanning for test files

### 2. Enhance Application Security
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add CSRF protection middleware
- Enhance authentication security
- Add rate limiting
- Implement security headers

### 3. Add Security Monitoring
- Enhance security event logging
- Add intrusion detection
- Create security audit trails
- Implement real-time threat detection

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Test Security Cleanup
- Replace hardcoded passwords with environment variables
- Create secure test data factories
- Implement test credential masking
- Add security linting rules

### Phase 2: Application Security Enhancement
- Create comprehensive input validation middleware
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- Add security headers middleware
- Implement rate limiting per endpoint
- Enhance password security policies

### Phase 3: Security Monitoring Enhancement
- Implement real-time security monitoring
- Add automated threat response
- Create security dashboard
- Implement security metrics collection

## Success Criteria
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- [ ] All inputs properly validated
- [ ] CSRF protection on all forms
- [ ] Security monitoring operational
- [ ] Security audit trails maintained
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
