# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the removal of deprecated libraries from the Kin Workspace CMS codebase and their replacement with platform-native functions. The npm install process currently shows warnings for deprecated packages that should be replaced with modern, native alternatives to improve security, performance, and maintainability.

## Glossary

- **CMS_System**: The Kin Workspace Content Management System
- **Deprecated_Library**: A software library that is no longer maintained or recommended for use
- **Platform_Native_Function**: Built-in functionality provided by Node.js, browsers, or the JavaScript runtime
- **Package_Manager**: npm package management system
- **Dependency_Tree**: The hierarchical structure of project dependencies

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove deprecated libraries from the codebase, so that the application uses modern, secure, and maintained dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Package_Manager installs dependencies, THE CMS_System SHALL NOT display deprecation warnings for lodash.isequal
2. WHEN the Package_Manager installs dependencies, THE CMS_System SHALL NOT display deprecation warnings for node-domexception
3. THE CMS_System SHALL use Node.js native util.isDeepStrictEqual instead of lodash.isequal
4. THE CMS_System SHALL use platform native DOMException instead of node-domexception
5. THE CMS_System SHALL maintain all existing functionality after library replacement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all deprecated dependencies in the project, so that I can systematically address technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CMS_System SHALL provide a complete audit of all deprecated dependencies in the Dependency_Tree
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies, THE CMS_System SHALL identify direct and transitive deprecated packages
3. THE CMS_System SHALL document the replacement strategy for each deprecated library
4. THE CMS_System SHALL prioritize replacements based on security and maintenance impact

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure code compatibility after removing deprecated libraries, so that the application continues to function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing deprecated libraries, THE CMS_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility for all existing APIs
2. THE CMS_System SHALL pass all existing tests after library replacement
3. WHEN using platform-native functions, THE CMS_System SHALL handle edge cases previously managed by deprecated libraries
4. THE CMS_System SHALL validate that performance characteristics remain equivalent or improved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent future deprecated library usage, so that the codebase remains modern and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CMS_System SHALL implement linting rules to detect deprecated library usage
2. WHEN new dependencies are added, THE CMS_System SHALL validate they are not deprecated
3. THE CMS_System SHALL document preferred alternatives for commonly used deprecated patterns
4. THE CMS_System SHALL update development guidelines to prevent deprecated library introduction
