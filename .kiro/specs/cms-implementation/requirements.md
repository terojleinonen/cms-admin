# CMS Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) for Kin Workspace. The CMS will be built using only free and open-source software, running entirely on local infrastructure without dependencies on commercial services. The system will provide full content management capabilities for the e-commerce platform while maintaining independence and data sovereignty.

3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL automatically log out users and require re-authentication
4. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions before allowing access
5. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information

### Requirement 5: API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RESTful APIs so that the CMS can communicate with the e-commerce frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the e-commerce site requests data THEN the CMS SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate requests using JWT tokens
3. WHEN data is synchronized THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between CMS and frontend
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Requirement 6: Content Workflow

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want workflow management so that I can control content publication and approval processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating content THEN the system SHALL support draft, review, and published states

5. WHEN tracking changes THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for all content

### Requirement 7: Dashboard & Analytics

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want comprehensive dashboards so that I can monitor site performance and content metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators (KPIs)
2. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL show page views, engagement metrics, and conversion data
3. WHEN monitoring inventory THEN the system SHALL display stock levels and product performance
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export data in common formats (CSV, PDF)
5. WHEN tracking trends THEN the system SHALL provide historical data visualization

### Requirement 8: Search & Filtering

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want powerful search capabilities so that I can quickly find and manage content.

3. WHEN handling concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through load balancing
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance metrics and alerts
