## User Management

### Accessing User Management

1. Navigate to **Admin > Users** in the main navigation
2. The user management dashboard provides:
   - Complete user list with role information
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Bulk operation tools
   - User activity monitoring

### Creating New Users

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Click "Add New User"**
2. **Fill in required information:**
   - Full name
   - Email address (must be unique)
   - Initial password (or send invitation)
   - Role assignment
3. **Set additional options:**
   - Account status (active/inactive)
   - Email verification requirement
   - Two-factor authentication requirement
4. **Review and create**

**Best practices:**
- Use strong initial passwords
- Require email verification for new accounts
- Assign the minimum necessary role initially
- Document the business justification for account creation

### Modifying User Roles

**Individual role changes:**

1. **Find the user** in the user list or search
2. **Click "Edit" or the user's name**
3. **In the role section:**
   - Select new role from dropdown
   - Add effective date (optional)
   - Add change reason (required)
4. **Save changes**

**Bulk role changes:**

1. **Select multiple users** using checkboxes
2. **Choose "Bulk Actions" > "Change Role"**
3. **Select new role and provide reason**
4. **Confirm the operation**

**Important notes:**
- Role changes take effect immediately
- Users don't need to log out and back in
- All role changes are logged in the audit trail
- Users receive notifications of role changes

### User Account Management

**Deactivating accounts:**
- Use "Deactivate" instead of deleting accounts
- Deactivated accounts retain audit history
- Can be reactivated if needed

**Password management:**
- Force password resets for security incidents
- Set password expiration policies
- Monitor failed login attempts

**Session management:**
- View active user sessions
- Force logout for security purposes
- Monitor concurrent session limits

## Role Configuration

### Understanding the Role Hierarchy

```
ADMIN (Highest Level)
├── Full system access
├── User and role management
├── Security configuration
├── System settings
└── All content permissions

EDITOR (Content Management)
├── Product management
├── Category management
├── Page management
├── Media management
├── Order processing (limited)
└── Profile management

VIEWER (Read-Only)
├── View products and categories
├── View orders
├── View basic analytics
└── Profile management only
```

### Creating Custom Roles

**When to create custom roles:**
- Standard roles don't meet specific business needs
- Need granular permission control
- Temporary or project-specific access requirements
- Compliance or regulatory requirements

**Steps to create custom roles:**

1. **Navigate to Admin > Roles**
2. **Click "Create Custom Role"**
3. **Define role properties:**
   - Role name (descriptive and unique)
   - Role description
   - Role hierarchy level
4. **Configure permissions:**
   - Select resource types (products, users, etc.)
   - Choose allowed actions (create, read, update, delete)
   - Set scope limitations (own, team, all)
5. **Test the role:**
   - Create a test user with the new role
   - Verify all permissions work as expected
   - Test edge cases and restrictions
6. **Document and deploy**

### Permission Matrix Management

**Accessing the permission matrix:**
- Go to **Admin > Roles > Permission Matrix**
- View shows all roles and their permissions
- Color-coded for easy visualization

**Understanding permission levels:**
- ✅ **Full Access**: Complete CRUD operations
- 👁️ **Read Only**: View access only
- 🔒 **No Access**: Completely restricted
- ⚠️ **Limited**: Restricted scope (own items only)

**Modifying permissions:**
1. Click on any cell in the matrix
2. Select new permission level
3. Provide change justification
4. Save changes (takes effect immediately)

## Permission Management

### Resource-Based Permissions

**Product Management:**
- `products:create` - Create new products
- `products:read` - View product information
- `products:update` - Modify existing products
- `products:delete` - Remove products
- `products:manage` - Full product control

**User Management:**
- `users:create` - Create new user accounts
- `users:read` - View user information
- `users:update` - Modify user details
- `users:delete` - Deactivate user accounts
- `users:manage` - Full user control

**Order Management:**
- `orders:read` - View order information
- `orders:update` - Modify order status
- `orders:process` - Process payments and fulfillment
- `orders:refund` - Issue refunds
- `orders:manage` - Full order control

**System Administration:**
- `system:configure` - Modify system settings
- `system:monitor` - Access monitoring tools
- `system:backup` - Perform system backups
- `system:audit` - Access audit logs
- `system:security` - Manage security settings

### Scope-Based Permissions

**Own Scope:**
- Users can only access their own data
- Example: `orders:read:own` - view only own orders

**Team Scope:**
- Access limited to team or department data
- Example: `products:manage:team` - manage team products

**All Scope:**
- Full access across all data
- Example: `users:read:all` - view all users

### Permission Inheritance

**Role hierarchy inheritance:**
- Higher roles inherit permissions from lower roles
- Admin inherits all Editor and Viewer permissions
- Editor inherits all Viewer permissions

**Custom role inheritance:**
- Can be configured during role creation
- Useful for specialized roles with base permissions
- Helps maintain consistency and reduces configuration
