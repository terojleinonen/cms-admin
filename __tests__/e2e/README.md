## Test Scenarios

### Admin User Workflows
- **Product Management**: Create, edit, delete products with full permissions
- **User Management**: Create, edit, delete users and manage roles
- **Analytics Access**: Full access to all analytics and reporting features
- **System Administration**: Access to system settings and configuration
- **Bulk Operations**: Perform bulk actions on multiple items

### Editor User Workflows
- **Content Management**: Create and edit products, categories, pages
- **Limited Analytics**: Access to content-related analytics
- **Restricted User Access**: Cannot manage users or system settings
- **Bulk Content Operations**: Limited bulk operations on content

### Viewer User Workflows
- **Read-Only Access**: View products, categories, and basic information
- **No Modification**: Cannot create, edit, or delete any content
- **Limited Navigation**: Access only to viewing-related pages
- **No Administrative Access**: Cannot access any admin features

### Permission Boundary Scenarios
- **Role Transitions**: Testing permission changes when user roles are updated
- **Unauthorized Access**: Attempting to access restricted resources
- **Permission Escalation**: Preventing users from gaining unauthorized permissions
- **Cross-Component Consistency**: Ensuring permissions are consistent across all components

### Integration Scenarios
- **Navigation to Forms**: Navigating from lists to edit forms with proper permissions
- **API to UI Consistency**: Ensuring API permissions match UI restrictions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission errors across components
- **Real-Time Updates**: Permission changes reflected immediately in UI

## Performance Testing

### Metrics Tracked
- **Permission Check Latency**: Average, P95, P99 response times
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of permission checks served from cache
- **Memory Usage**: Baseline, peak, and average memory consumption
- **Concurrent Users**: System performance under load
- **Requests Per Second**: Throughput under various load conditions

### Performance Requirements
- Permission checks: < 50ms average, < 100ms P95
- Cache hit ratio: > 85%
- Memory usage: < 500MB peak
- Support 100+ concurrent users
- Handle 500+ requests per second

## Security Testing

### Security Scenarios Covered
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Input validation and parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Output sanitization and CSP headers
- **CSRF Token Validation**: Proper token validation on state-changing operations
- **Session Security**: Session hijacking prevention and secure session management
- **Privilege Escalation**: Prevention of unauthorized permission elevation
- **API Security**: Proper authentication and authorization on all endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all user inputs
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events

## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Components
- **MockDashboard**: Simulates main dashboard with role-based features
- **MockProductManagement**: Product CRUD operations with permissions
- **MockUserManagement**: User management with admin-only access
- **MockAnalytics**: Analytics dashboard with role-based data access
- **MockNavigation**: Navigation components with permission filtering

### Mock Data
- **User Sessions**: Pre-configured sessions for each role type
- **API Responses**: Mocked API responses for various scenarios
- **Permission Configurations**: Test permission matrices for all roles
- **Error Scenarios**: Mocked error conditions and edge cases

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Statements**: 90%
- **Branches**: 85%
- **Functions**: 90%
- **Lines**: 90%

### Coverage Areas
- All permission checking logic
- Role-based UI rendering
- API permission validation
- Error handling and recovery
- Cross-component integration points

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Context Not Available**: Ensure PermissionProvider wraps test components
2. **Mock Session Issues**: Verify session structure matches expected format
3. **Async Operation Timing**: Use proper waitFor() for async operations
4. **Component Rendering**: Check that components render with expected permissions

### Debug Tools
- **Test Utils**: Helper functions for creating mock sessions and data
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging of permission checks and decisions
- **Coverage Reports**: Identify untested code paths
- **Performance Profiling**: Monitor test execution performance

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include tests for all user roles where applicable
3. Add both positive and negative test cases
4. Update coverage requirements if needed
5. Document new test scenarios in this README

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
2. Update all affected test files when changing permission logic
3. Verify coverage requirements are still met
4. Update documentation to reflect changes

## Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Testing
- All E2E workflow tests run on every pull request
- Coverage reports generated and validated
- Performance benchmarks tracked over time
- Security scan results integrated with test results

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage requirements must be met
- Performance benchmarks must not regress
- Security scans must pass without critical issues

This comprehensive E2E test suite ensures that the production-ready RBAC system works correctly across all user roles, components, and integration points while maintaining high performance and security standards.
