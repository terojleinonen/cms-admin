# Role Configuration Interface Guide

## Overview

The Role Configuration Interface is a comprehensive administrative tool for managing roles, permissions, and access control in the CMS system. It provides three main views for different aspects of role management:

1. **Permission Matrix** - Visual grid for editing role permissions
2. **Role Management** - Individual role configuration and management
3. **Role Hierarchy** - Visual representation of role hierarchy levels

## Features

### Permission Matrix Editor

The Permission Matrix provides a spreadsheet-like interface for managing permissions:

- **Resource Expansion**: Click on resource names to expand and see individual actions
- **Permission Toggle**: Click on checkboxes to enable/disable permissions for each role
- **Visual Indicators**: Green checkmarks for enabled permissions, gray X's for disabled
- **Permission Counts**: Shows how many permissions each role has for each resource
- **Bulk Operations**: Save all changes at once with the "Save Changes" button

### Custom Role Creation

Create new roles with specific permission sets:

- **Role Information**: Name, description, and hierarchy level
- **Permission Selection**: Choose specific permissions from all available resources
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate role names and validates required fields
- **Hierarchy Management**: Assign hierarchy levels to establish role precedence

### Role Hierarchy Visualization

View and understand the role structure:

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Roles displayed in order from highest to lowest hierarchy level
- **Role Details**: Shows permissions count and hierarchy level for each role
- **Built-in vs Custom**: Clear distinction between system roles and custom roles
- **Quick Edit**: Direct access to role editing from the hierarchy view

## Built-in Roles

The system comes with three built-in roles:

### Administrator (Hierarchy: 3)
- **Full system access** including user management and system settings
- **All permissions** across all resources and scopes
- **Cannot be deleted** but permissions can be modified
- **User management**: Create, read, update, delete users
- **System settings**: Configure security, monitoring, and system parameters

### Editor (Hierarchy: 2)
- **Content management access** for products, categories, pages, and media
- **Full CRUD operations** on content resources
- **Read-only access** to orders and analytics
- **Own profile management** only
- **Cannot manage users** or system settings

### Viewer (Hierarchy: 1)
- **Read-only access** to most content
- **Cannot create, edit, or delete** content
- **Own profile management** only
- **Basic dashboard access** for viewing data

## Permission Model

The system uses a **Resource-Action-Scope** (RAS) permission model:

### Resources
- `users` - User account management
- `products` - Product catalog management
- `categories` - Category management
- `pages` - Content page management
- `media` - Media file management
- `orders` - Order processing
- `settings` - System configuration
- `security` - Security and audit management
- `analytics` - Reports and analytics
- `monitoring` - System monitoring

### Actions
- `create` - Create new items
- `read` - View/read items
- `update` - Edit existing items
- `delete` - Remove items
- `manage` - Full management (includes all other actions)

### Scopes
- `all` - Access to all items of the resource type
- `own` - Access only to items owned by the user
- `team` - Access to team-related items (future enhancement)

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Interface

1. Navigate to `/admin/roles` in the admin dashboard
2. Ensure you have Administrator role privileges
3. The interface loads with the Permission Matrix tab active

### Editing Permissions

1. **Via Permission Matrix**:
   - Click on resource names to expand action details
   - Click checkboxes to toggle permissions on/off
   - Use "Save Changes" button to apply modifications
   - Changes are highlighted until saved

2. **Via Role Management**:
   - Switch to "Role Management" tab
   - Click edit icon on any role card
   - Modify role details and permissions in the modal
   - Save changes to update the role

### Creating Custom Roles

1. Click "Create Role" button in the top-right corner
2. Fill in role information:
   - **Name**: Unique, descriptive role name
   - **Description**: Clear explanation of the role's purpose
   - **Hierarchy Level**: Numeric level (higher = more privileges)
3. Select permissions by checking boxes for each resource/action/scope combination
4. Click "Create Role" to save

### Managing Role Hierarchy

1. Switch to "Role Hierarchy" tab
2. View roles ordered by hierarchy level (highest to lowest)
3. Click the settings icon to edit role details
4. Adjust hierarchy levels to change role precedence

### Deleting Custom Roles

1. Go to "Role Management" tab
2. Find the custom role (marked with "Custom" badge)
3. Click the trash icon
4. Confirm deletion in the warning dialog
5. **Note**: Built-in roles cannot be deleted

## Best Practices

### Role Design
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, self-explanatory role names
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Assign hierarchy levels that reflect actual authority
- **Documentation**: Provide clear descriptions for each role's purpose

### Permission Management
- **Regular Review**: Periodically audit role permissions
- **Test Changes**: Verify permission changes in a test environment first
- **Backup Configuration**: Export role configurations before major changes
- **User Communication**: Inform users when their role permissions change

### Security Considerations
- **Admin Access**: Only trusted administrators should access role configuration
- **Change Tracking**: All role modifications are logged for audit purposes
- **Permission Validation**: System validates permissions at multiple levels
- **Session Management**: Role changes may require users to re-login

## API Integration

The role configuration interface integrates with the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/admin/roles` - Fetch all roles and configurations
- `POST /api/admin/roles` - Create new custom roles
- `PUT /api/admin/roles` - Update existing roles
- `DELETE /api/admin/roles` - Delete custom roles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Matrix Not Loading**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify admin user has proper permissions
- Refresh the page and try again

**Cannot Save Changes**
- Ensure you have unsaved changes (button should be visible)
- Check network connectivity
- Verify session hasn't expired

**Role Creation Fails**
- Check for duplicate role names
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify hierarchy level is a valid number

**Built-in Role Restrictions**
- Built-in roles cannot be deleted
- Some properties of built-in roles cannot be modified
- Only permissions can be updated for built-in roles

### Error Messages

- **"Role name already exists"**: Choose a different, unique role name
- **"Unauthorized - Admin access required"**: User lacks administrator privileges
- **"Cannot delete built-in roles"**: Attempting to delete system roles
- **"Cannot modify built-in role properties"**: Trying to change protected role attributes

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `RoleConfigurationInterface` - Main container component
- `ResourcePermissionRows` - Permission matrix row renderer
- `CreateRoleModal` - New role creation dialog
- `EditRoleModal` - Role editing dialog
- `DeleteRoleConfirmModal` - Deletion confirmation dialog

### State Management
- Local React state for UI interactions
- Permission configuration manager for data persistence
- Real-time updates with change tracking
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Permission validation testing
- Error handling and edge case coverage

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Role Templates**: Pre-configured role templates for common use cases
- **Permission Inheritance**: Child roles inheriting parent permissions
- **Conditional Permissions**: Time-based or context-dependent permissions
- **Bulk User Assignment**: Assign roles to multiple users simultaneously
- **Permission Analytics**: Usage statistics and permission effectiveness metrics

### Integration Opportunities
- **LDAP/Active Directory**: Import roles from external directory services
- **SSO Integration**: Role mapping from single sign-on providers
