## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**: Potential data loss during test database setup
   - **Mitigation**: Use separate test database, implement rollback procedures
2. **Authentication Changes**: Breaking existing auth functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout, fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance Regression**: New implementations slowing down tests
   - **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking, optimization guidelines, monitoring

### Contingency Plans
1. **If Phase 1 fails**: Focus on minimal viable fixes to get tests running
2. **If API implementations are complex**: Create minimal stub implementations first
3. **If component implementations are time-consuming**: Prioritize most critical components
4. **If coverage targets are missed**: Identify and focus on high-impact areas

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to transforming the failing test suite into a reliable, comprehensive testing infrastructure that supports the CMS development lifecycle effectively.
