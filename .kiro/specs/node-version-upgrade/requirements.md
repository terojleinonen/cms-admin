# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Node.js version compatibility warnings in the CMS Admin project. The current Node.js version (v18.20.8) is causing engine compatibility warnings with several packages that require Node.js 20 or higher. This upgrade will ensure compatibility with all dependencies and improve development experience.

## Glossary

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development
- **npm**: Node Package Manager for managing JavaScript dependencies
- **Engine Compatibility**: Version requirements specified by packages for supported runtime environments
- **CMS Admin**: The Kin Workspace Content Management System
- **Package Dependencies**: External libraries and modules required by the project

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade to a supported Node.js version, so that I can eliminate engine compatibility warnings and ensure all dependencies work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized, THE CMS Admin SHALL run on Node.js version 20 or higher
2. WHEN npm install is executed, THE CMS Admin SHALL not display engine compatibility warnings
3. WHEN the development server starts, THE CMS Admin SHALL function without version-related errors
4. WHERE Node.js version checking is implemented, THE CMS Admin SHALL validate minimum version requirements
5. THE CMS Admin SHALL maintain all existing functionality after the Node.js upgrade

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation and configuration, so that other team members can set up the project with the correct Node.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project documentation, THE CMS Admin SHALL specify Node.js 20+ as a requirement
2. WHEN setting up the development environment, THE CMS Admin SHALL provide clear version requirements
3. WHERE version management tools are used, THE CMS Admin SHALL include configuration for Node.js 20+
4. THE CMS Admin SHALL include instructions for upgrading from Node.js 18 to 20+
5. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run, THE CMS Admin SHALL use Node.js 20+ in all environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify package compatibility, so that all dependencies work correctly with the new Node.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package installation completes, THE CMS Admin SHALL have no dependency conflicts
2. WHEN running tests, THE CMS Admin SHALL execute all test suites successfully
3. WHEN building for production, THE CMS Admin SHALL compile without version-related errors
4. WHERE package vulnerabilities exist, THE CMS Admin SHALL address security issues during upgrade
5. THE CMS Admin SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing features
