# Production-Ready Role-Based Access Control System

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive, production-ready role-based access control (RBAC) system for the Kin Workspace CMS. The system must ensure secure, consistent, and user-friendly access control across all application layers while providing proper testing coverage and monitoring capabilities.

The current implementation has inconsistent role checking, missing security validations, and inadequate testing coverage. This specification addresses these issues to create a robust, production-ready system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Permission System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a granular permission system that controls access to all resources and actions, so that users can only perform operations they are authorized for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system checks permissions THEN it SHALL use a centralized permission service with resource-action-scope model
2. WHEN defining role permissions THEN the system SHALL support granular permissions for each resource (products, users, analytics, etc.)
3. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL validate both frontend UI visibility and backend API access
4. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect new permissions without requiring re-login
5. WHEN permissions are cached THEN the system SHALL invalidate cache appropriately when roles or permissions change

### Requirement 2: Secure Route Protection

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all application routes protected by middleware, so that unauthorized access is prevented at the infrastructure level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any protected route THEN the system SHALL validate authentication and authorization via middleware
2. WHEN route protection fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate error pages (401, 403) with clear messaging
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate permissions server-side before processing requests
4. WHEN middleware runs THEN it SHALL log all access attempts for security monitoring
5. WHEN routes require specific permissions THEN the system SHALL check both role and resource-level permissions

### Requirement 3: Role-Aware User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to show only features and actions I'm authorized to use, so that I have a clean, relevant experience without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering navigation menus THEN the system SHALL show only items the user has permission to access
2. WHEN displaying action buttons THEN the system SHALL hide buttons for unauthorized operations
3. WHEN showing search results THEN the system SHALL filter results based on user's read permissions
4. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL show only notifications relevant to user's role and permissions
5. WHEN forms are rendered THEN the system SHALL disable fields the user cannot modify

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all role-based scenarios, so that permission logic is reliable and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running component tests THEN the system SHALL test all role combinations for UI components
2. WHEN running API tests THEN the system SHALL verify permission validation for all endpoints
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete user workflows for each role
4. WHEN running E2E tests THEN the system SHALL simulate real user interactions for all role scenarios
5. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL achieve minimum 90% coverage for permission-related code

### Requirement 5: Security Hardening and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security measures and monitoring, so that unauthorized access attempts are detected and prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL log all operations in a comprehensive audit trail
2. WHEN suspicious activity occurs THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts and monitoring
3. WHEN input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all data server-side
4. WHEN security events happen THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring and alerting
5. WHEN permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for security analysis

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the permission system to perform efficiently under load, so that user experience remains smooth as the system scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking permissions frequently THEN the system SHALL use intelligent caching to minimize database queries
2. WHEN the system scales THEN permission checks SHALL not become a performance bottleneck
3. WHEN caching permissions THEN the system SHALL ensure cache consistency across all application instances
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track permission check latency and throughput
5. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times for permission checks

### Requirement 7: Administrative Management Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a comprehensive interface to manage roles and permissions, so that I can efficiently control system access and monitor user activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces to view, edit, and assign roles
2. WHEN viewing permissions THEN the system SHALL show clear permission matrices for all roles
3. WHEN monitoring access THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing user activity and access patterns
4. WHEN managing roles THEN the system SHALL allow creation of custom roles with specific permission sets
5. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports of user actions and permission usage
