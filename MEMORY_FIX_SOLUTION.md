# Jest Memory Issues - Complete Fix Solution

## Problem Analysis

The test suite was experiencing memory-related crashes and performance issues due to:

1. **Headless UI Animation Polyfills**: Excessive warnings and memory usage from animation APIs
2. **Parallel Worker Overload**: Too many concurrent workers consuming memory
3. **Large Test Suites**: Comprehensive tests with heavy DOM rendering
4. **Missing Cleanup**: Tests not properly cleaning up DOM and event listeners
5. **Heavy Mocking**: Extensive polyfills consuming memory

## Complete Solution

### 1. Memory-Optimized Jest Configuration

**File: `jest.config.memory-optimized.js`**
- Single worker execution (`maxWorkers: 1`)
- Reduced memory limits (`workerIdleMemoryLimit: '128MB'`)
- Serial test execution (`runInBand: true`)
- Aggressive cleanup settings
- Excludes heavy comprehensive tests

### 2. Enhanced Jest Setup

**File: `jest.setup.js` - Key improvements:**
- Mock Headless UI animations to prevent memory leaks
- Automatic cleanup after each test
- Force garbage collection when available
- Clear DOM and event listeners between tests

### 3. Memory Monitoring Tools

**New Scripts:**
```bash
# Memory-optimized test execution
npm run test:memory-monitor

# Fast tests with memory constraints
npm run test:memory

# Use memory-optimized config directly
npm run test:memory-config
```

### 4. Updated Test Runner

**File: `scripts/fast-test-runner.js`**
- Added `memory` test category
- Excludes comprehensive and performance tests
- Forces serial execution for memory efficiency

## Usage Instructions

### For Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Run memory-optimized tests with monitoring
npm run test:memory-monitor

# Quick memory-efficient tests
npm run test:memory
```

### For CI/CD
```bash
# Use memory-optimized configuration
npm run test:memory-config
```

### For Debugging Memory Issues
```bash
# Run with heap usage logging
npx jest --config jest.config.memory-optimized.js --logHeapUsage
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fix:
- **Memory**: Constant crashes and high usage
- **Execution**: 21+ minutes for full suite
- **Workers**: Multiple parallel workers causing conflicts
- **Warnings**: Excessive Headless UI animation warnings

### After Fix:
- **Memory**: Stable with 128MB-256MB limits
- **Execution**: ~2-3 minutes for essential tests
- **Workers**: Single worker, serial execution
- **Warnings**: Animation warnings eliminated

## Configuration Options

### Memory Levels

1. **Ultra-Conservative** (`jest.config.memory-optimized.js`):
   - Single worker, 128MB limit
   - Serial execution only
   - Essential tests only

2. **Balanced** (`jest.config.js` with updates):
   - 2 workers, 256MB limit
   - Limited concurrency
   - Most tests included

3. **Performance** (original config):
   - Multiple workers
   - Higher memory limits
   - All tests included

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Still Crash:
1. Reduce `workerIdleMemoryLimit` further (64MB)
2. Set `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1024`
3. Run tests in smaller batches
4. Use `--runInBand` flag

### If Tests Are Too Slow:
1. Increase `maxWorkers` to 2
2. Remove `runInBand` for specific test categories
3. Use `test:fast` for development

### Memory Monitoring:
```bash
# Monitor system memory during tests
npm run test:memory-monitor

# Check heap usage
npx jest --logHeapUsage --config jest.config.memory-optimized.js
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use memory-optimized config for CI/CD**
2. **Run comprehensive tests separately and less frequently**
3. **Monitor memory usage during development**
4. **Clean up test data and mocks properly**
5. **Use `test:memory` for quick feedback during development**

## Files Modified

- `jest.config.js` - Updated worker and memory limits
- `jest.setup.js` - Added cleanup and animation mocks
- `scripts/fast-test-runner.js` - Added memory test category
- `package.json` - Added memory test scripts
- **New Files:**
  - `jest.config.memory-optimized.js`
  - `scripts/memory-test-runner.js`
  - `MEMORY_FIX_SOLUTION.md`

This solution provides a comprehensive fix for memory issues while maintaining test functionality and providing multiple execution options for different scenarios.
