# Codebase Simplification Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic simplification of the Kin Workspace CMS codebase to reduce technical debt, improve maintainability, and enhance future-proofing while preserving core functionality. The analysis focuses on identifying over-engineered components, redundant dependencies, and complex abstractions that can be simplified without losing essential features.

## Glossary

- **CMS_System**: The Kin Workspace Content Management System
- **Core_Functionality**: Essential features required for product management, user authentication, and content operations
- **Technical_Debt**: Code complexity, redundant dependencies, and over-engineered solutions that impede development
- **Dependency_Footprint**: The total number and complexity of external packages used by the system
- **Testing_Infrastructure**: The comprehensive test suite including unit, integration, performance, and security tests
- **Permission_System**: The role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- **Monitoring_Infrastructure**: Performance monitoring, security monitoring, and audit logging systems

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified codebase with minimal dependencies, so that I can maintain and extend the system more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies, THE CMS_System SHALL identify packages that can be replaced with native implementations
2. WHEN evaluating UI components, THE CMS_System SHALL consolidate @headlessui/react and @heroicons/react usage to essential components only
3. WHEN reviewing search functionality, THE CMS_System SHALL assess if minisearch can be replaced with native database search
4. WHEN examining authentication features, THE CMS_System SHALL determine if otplib and qrcode can be simplified or removed
5. WHERE Redis caching is implemented, THE CMS_System SHALL evaluate if in-memory caching suffices for the current scale

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to reduce the testing infrastructure complexity, so that testing remains effective while being more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing test structure, THE CMS_System SHALL consolidate overlapping test categories
2. WHEN analyzing performance tests, THE CMS_System SHALL determine if specialized performance testing can be simplified
3. WHEN examining security tests, THE CMS_System SHALL identify redundant security test patterns
4. WHEN evaluating test helpers, THE CMS_System SHALL consolidate duplicate testing utilities
5. WHERE jest-mock-extended is used, THE CMS_System SHALL assess if native Jest mocking suffices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want simplified permission and monitoring systems, so that the core business logic is not obscured by over-engineered abstractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the Permission_System, THE CMS_System SHALL identify if the current RBAC complexity exceeds business requirements
2. WHEN analyzing audit logging, THE CMS_System SHALL determine if the comprehensive audit trail can be simplified
3. WHEN examining security monitoring, THE CMS_System SHALL assess if real-time monitoring features are necessary for current scale
4. WHEN evaluating performance monitoring, THE CMS_System SHALL identify if specialized performance tracking can be reduced
5. WHERE caching layers exist, THE CMS_System SHALL determine optimal caching strategy for current usage patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused or over-engineered features, so that the codebase focuses on essential functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing database schema, THE CMS_System SHALL identify unused tables and relationships
2. WHEN reviewing API endpoints, THE CMS_System SHALL determine if all endpoints serve active use cases
3. WHEN examining component libraries, THE CMS_System SHALL identify components that can be simplified or consolidated
4. WHEN evaluating utility functions, THE CMS_System SHALL remove redundant or unused utilities
5. WHERE complex abstractions exist, THE CMS_System SHALL assess if simpler implementations would suffice

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want a future-proof architecture with minimal external dependencies, so that the system remains stable and secure over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating dependency updates, THE CMS_System SHALL minimize the number of packages requiring regular maintenance
2. WHEN assessing security vulnerabilities, THE CMS_System SHALL reduce attack surface through dependency reduction
3. WHEN considering long-term maintenance, THE CMS_System SHALL prioritize native implementations over external packages
4. WHEN planning feature development, THE CMS_System SHALL ensure simplified architecture supports future growth
5. WHERE third-party integrations exist, THE CMS_System SHALL evaluate if they can be replaced with simpler alternatives
