**Features**:
- Automatic GitHub issue creation for failures
- Slack integration (when configured)
- Test execution summaries on commits
- Automatic issue resolution tracking

### 4. Deployment Gate (`deployment-gate.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to main, Manual dispatch

**Jobs**:
- **Pre-deployment Validation**: Environment checks
- **Security Gate**: Security audits and validation
- **Build for Deployment**: Full test suite and production build
- **Deployment Approval**: Manual approval for production
- **Create Deployment**: GitHub deployment tracking
- **Post-deployment Verification**: Health checks and smoke tests
- **Rollback on Failure**: Automatic rollback and issue creation

**Features**:
- Environment-specific deployment logic
- Manual approval gates for production
- Comprehensive pre-deployment validation
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Deployment status tracking

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gates

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% across all metrics
- **Coverage Types**: Branches, Functions, Lines, Statements
- **Exclusions**: Layout files, page components, type definitions
- **Enforcement**: Builds fail if coverage drops below threshold

### Security Gates
- **Dependency Auditing**: npm audit with moderate level
- **Secret Scanning**: Basic secret detection
- **Vulnerability Checks**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Configuration Validation**: Environment and deployment validation

### Performance Gates
- **Test Execution Time**: Monitored and reported
- **Build Performance**: Production build validation
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU monitoring
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Automated detection and reporting

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Staging**: Automatic deployment from `main` branch
2. **Production**: Manual approval required, triggered from `main`

### Deployment Process
1. **Pre-deployment Validation**: All tests pass, security checks complete
2. **Build Verification**: Production build succeeds
3. **Approval Gate**: Manual approval for production (environment protection)
4. **Deployment Execution**: GitHub deployment creation and tracking
5. **Post-deployment Verification**: Health checks and smoke tests
6. **Rollback on Failure**: Automatic rollback with issue creation

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Failure Notifications
- **GitHub Issues**: Automatic creation for persistent failures
- **Slack Notifications**: Real-time alerts (when configured)
- **Commit Status**: Status updates on commits
- **PR Comments**: Coverage and test result summaries

### Performance Monitoring
