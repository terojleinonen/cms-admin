## 💡 Recommendations
- Optimize 1 slow unit tests - consider mocking external dependencies
- Slowest unit tests: performance test
- 4 tests using excessive memory - check for memory leaks
- Investigate and fix failing tests to improve pass rate
- Review and fix security issues in test code
- Use environment variables for sensitive test data
- Implement proper data masking in test outputs
- Add descriptive test suite descriptions
- Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Add comments to explain complex test logic
